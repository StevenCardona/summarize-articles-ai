# 🧠 AI Blog Summarizer App

A clean, responsive, and fast React application that allows users to **summarize the content of any blog or webpage using AI**. Just paste a URL, and the app returns a short, intelligent summary of the main content.

Built following a hands-on project tutorial that teaches modern React development with **Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**.
